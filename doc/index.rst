recursive_diff: Compare two Python data structures
**************************************************
JSON and YAML are two massively popular formats used to represent nested data. A problem
arises when you want to compare two large JSON data structures, because the `==`
operator will tell you if the two structures differ somewhere*, but won't tell you
*where*. Additionally, if the structures contain floating-point numbers, == won't allow
to set a tolerance: 1.00000000000001 is different from 1.0, which is majorly problematic
as floating point arithmetics are naturally characterised by noise around the 15th
decimal position (the size of the mantissa). Tests on floating point numbers are
typically performed with :func:`math.isclose` or :func:`numpy.isclose`, which however
are not usable if the numbers to be tested lie deep inside a nested structure.

A second problem that data scientists need to face routinely is comparing huge
numpy-based data structures, such as :class:`pandas.DataFrame` objects or data loaded
from HDF5 datastores. Again, it is very frequently needed to identify *where*
differences are, and apply tolerance to the comparison.

This module offers the function :func:`~recursive_diff.recursive_diff`, which crawls
through two arbitrarily large nested JSON-like structures and dumps out all the
differences. Python-specific data types, such as :class:`set` and :class:`tuple`, are
also supported. `numpy`_, `pandas`_, and `xarray`_ are supported and optimized for
speed.

Another function, :func:`~recursive_diff.recursive_eq`, is designed to be used in unit
tests.

Finally, the command-line tool :doc:`ncdiff` allows comparing two NetCDF files, or two
directories full of NetCDF files, as long as they can be loaded with
:func:`xarray.open_dataset`.

Examples
========

.. code::

    from recursive_diff import recursive_diff

    lhs = {
        'foo': [1, 2, ('one', 5.2), 4],
        'only_lhs': 1
    }
    rhs = {
        'foo': [1, 2, ['two', 5.200001, 3]],
        'only_rhs': 1
    }

    for diff in recursive_diff(lhs, rhs, abs_tol=.1):
        print(diff)

Output::

    Pair only_lhs:1 is in LHS only
    Pair only_rhs:1 is in RHS only
    [foo]: LHS has 1 more elements than RHS: [4]
    [foo][2]: object type differs: tuple != list
    [foo][2]: RHS has 1 more elements than LHS: [3]
    [foo][2][0]: one != two


Or as a unit test:

.. code::

    from recursive_diff import recursive_eq

    def test1():
        recursive_eq(lhs, rhs, abs_tol=.1)

py.test output::

    ==================== FAILURES ===================
    E       AssertionError: 6 differences found

    -------------- Captured stdout call --------------

    Pair only_lhs:1 is in LHS only
    Pair only_rhs:1 is in RHS only
    [foo]: LHS has 1 more elements than RHS: [4]
    [foo][2]: object type differs: tuple != list
    [foo][2]: RHS has 1 more elements than LHS: [3]
    [foo][2][0]: one != two
